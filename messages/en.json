    "title": "About Yuri",
    "description": "I'm Yuri, born in Natal, a beautiful coastal city in Northeastern Brazil. 8 years ago, I decided to move to Argentina, where I found a new home and an amazing community. Since then, I've lived in Argentina and dedicated my life to sharing my language and culture with people from all over. My Portuguese classes have helped many people achieve their personal, professional, and academic goals, accompanying them in their learning process with dedication, empathy, and passion. I'm proud to see how my students manage to communicate fluently, discover new opportunities, and connect with Brazilian culture. It'll be a pleasure to accompany you on your path to mastering Portuguese!",
